### Me

Hi, I'm Jagadeesh Kumar.

I hail from Bangalore, India. Though, I am staying in California, USA.

I currently live in Sunnyvale, working as a Data Scientist at Apple, Inc. 
In the past I've worked as a Technical Lead in a service oriented startup, <em>Energy Umpire</em> based in Melbourne, Victoria.

So yeah, I have my fair share of startup experience, and the usual get sh*t done attitude that comes with it.

I'm also <em>really</em> into indie rock, creative writing, travelling, and caffeine. I cycle between other hobbies as well, with the change of seasons.

  • Python • Scikit-Learn • NLTK • Pandas • Numpy 
  • Java • Javascript • Flask 
  • MySQL • MongoDB • Neo4j
  • Spark • Docker 

for use with concepts such as:

Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Analytics, Statistical Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Data Visualization, Database Systems & Information Modelling • Software Engineering • Web Application Development, <em>and more!</em>


### Certificates I've completed:
